# Vanilla-Linux-Prototype
This is a personal project aimed at building a bootable, minimal Linux kernel from scratch without relying on any GNU userland, shell, or graphical interface. The goal is not to create a complete operating system, but rather to understand and practice how to configure, compile, and boot a standalone Linux kernel on bare metal or a virtual machine.
