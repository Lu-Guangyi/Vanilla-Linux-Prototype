# Vanilla-Linux-Prototype
This is a personal project focused on building a bootable, minimal Linux kernel from scratch, without relying on any GNU userland, shell, or graphical interface. The goal is not to create a complete operating system, but to gain hands-on experience in configuring, compiling, and booting a standalone Linux kernel on bare metal or in a virtual machine.

# I'll make another repository seperated from this one with Gnu integration.
